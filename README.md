# 🎮 Physics Game Builder

An interactive Python + Pygame platform that enables students to **build and play physics-based games** while learning core STEM concepts like gravity, motion, velocity, and collisions.

This project is inspired by my EdTech teaching experience at **CampK12** during the COVID-19 era, where we blended game-based learning with real-time coding instruction for school students.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Physics simulation (gravity, friction, collision detection)
- Level builder interface (planned)
- Drag-and-drop objects with editable properties (mass, bounce, etc.)
- Save and load custom-built games
- Educational + creative fusion for kids and beginners
